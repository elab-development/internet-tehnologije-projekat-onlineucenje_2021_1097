        A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink. Most commonly, cocktails are
        either a single spirit or combination of spirits mixed with other
        ingredients such as tonic water, fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream.
        Cocktails vary widely across regions of the world, and many websites
        publish both original recipes and their own interpretations of older and
        more famous cocktails.
